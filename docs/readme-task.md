Create a read me file to talk about this project for github. Here is the outline that I want.

### Summary

- Explain what the contosovac agent is and what problems it solves and the users it focuses on
- Read the content in the images in docs/slide images folder to get more context
- Don’t mention that this was an interview task.  Just say it was a project to explore the “Custom GPT” feature of ChatGPT as a way to create agents quickly that perform small tasks
- Link to the video demo on youtube - https://youtu.be/hiyg4dvjclo
